# Updating Translations 

There are two ways to update the language files. Using free software or a WordPress plugin.

If you'd like to update the files using free software, you can use the [Poedit](https://poedit.net/). If you'd like to update the files in your WordPress dashboard, you can use the [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin.

1- Please go to the [enfold-language-files](https://github.com/KriesiMedia/enfold-language-files) and download the repository
![Download the repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5331416/197038874-d4b43327-6fe3-4b11-98e9-62cb5a50c390.png)

2- Open the /enfold-language-files/lang/ folder, copy the language files you'd like to edit (both .po and .mo files), and paste it into the /wp-content/themes/enfold/lang/ folder.

3- If you're using Poedit, please open the .po file inside the /wp-content/themes/enfold/lang/ folder, and click the Update from source code button before you start translating

If you're using the Loco Translate plugin, please go to the WordPress admin panel > Loco Translate > Themes > Enfold, select the language you'd like to translate, and click the Sync button before you start translating

4- After you save, you can find the updated language files inside the /wp-content/themes/enfold/lang/ folder.

# Submitting Translations
If you have a GitHub account (or do not mind creating one), you can easily submit your translations to us. 


1- Go to https://github.com/KriesiMedia/enfold-language-files and click the "Fork" button 

![Fork image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5331416/197038042-15690550-98b3-4ed1-852b-35ba4ab5f5c1.png)


2- Please download the repository you have forked and use language files in it instead of language files inside the Enfold/lang folder. This way, we are going to minimize the risk of overwriting files.

If you would not like to use GitHub, you can still submit your language files to [our forum](https://kriesi.at/support/topic/please-contribute-and-translate-enfold/). But always use the latest files from this repository and not theme files !!
